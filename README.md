# About

This project was used to display a chessboard in my LinkedIn page's about section which could be updated from an external website.
I hosted the backend on an AWS EC2 instance while I had the free trial and I don't feel like paying for it or moving the backend to a new server. Also that site never seemed to get any traffic anyways.
